# SHOFUN
SHOFUN is Augmented Reality (AR) clothing try-on application that allows users to virtually experiment with different outfits in real time. This project leverages AR technology to enhance the online shopping experience, enabling users to visualize how clothing fits and looks without physically wearing them.
